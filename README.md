# python-encryption-lab
 A Python-based CLI tool that implements classical ciphers like Caesar, Affine, Vigenère, Reverse, and Substitution for encryption and decryption.
---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Reverse Cipher
- 🔄 Caesar Cipher (with Bruteforce)
- 🧮 Affine Cipher (with Bruteforce)
- 🔤 Simple Substitution Cipher
- 🔑 Vigenère Cipher

Each cipher provides options for ciphering, deciphering, and in some cases, bruteforce.
